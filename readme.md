## Overview

This is a simple adding machine, built as a part of my portfolio. This application allows users to add two numbers together. The project is mainly built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it's small, it came from a project in our first class on JavaScript during my Front-End Web Design course. The original assignment asked us to create there window.alerts which asked for two numbers and returned the sum of them. The assignment was a simple one and I enjoyed playing with it and expanding it. Now the only alerts are part of the input validation.
